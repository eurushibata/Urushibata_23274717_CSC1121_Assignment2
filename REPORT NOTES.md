For this tutorial (and because Wikipedia has a quite sensitive DDoS pro-tection) the web crawler will be crawling with only one thread (no paralle-lism). Additionally, only links will be queued which havenâ€™t been seen before and point to another page on Wikipedia. To check if the links found are valid for further crawling, the original host is compared to a fixed list of hosts (in this case only https://en.wikipedia.org).



Avoid to many parallel requests as this might activate DDoS protection

# requests being blocked by 403
we have to assign a header https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Policy:Wikimedia_Foundation_User-Agent_Policy

Python
In Python, you can use the Requests library to set a header:
```
import requests

url = 'https://example/...'
headers = {'User-Agent': 'CoolBot/0.0 (https://example.org/coolbot/; coolbot@example.org)'}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
```

# process
image was minified so I get the article, then the title via tag class - mw-page-title-main

and I get the metadata of this info via this API=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=pageimages&format=json&piprop=original&titles=


note that no political view was applied here since I acquired the images via random article access on wiki API.
